# Binary Tree Data Structure

A **Binary Tree** is a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. In a binary tree, each element can have only 2 children, typically named the left and right child.

## Binary Tree Representation

A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node, commonly known as the "root" of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL. Each node of a Binary Tree contains the following parts:

- Data
- Pointer to left child
- Pointer to right child

## Basic Operations on Binary Tree

The basic operations that can be performed on a Binary Tree include:

1. **Inserting an element.**
2. **Removing an element.**
3. **Searching for an element.**
4. **Traversing the tree.**

```java
// Class containing left and right child
// of current node and key value
class Node {
	int key;
	Node left, right;

	public Node(int item)
	{
		key = item;
		left = right = null;
	}
}
```

## Applications of Binary Trees

Binary Trees are versatile data structures with various applications in computer science and beyond:

1. **Expression Trees**: Used in compilers to represent expressions for parsing and evaluation.

2. **Huffman Coding Trees**: Employed in data compression algorithms to create efficient encodings.

3. **Priority Queue**: Utilized for fast retrieval of maximum or minimum values in O(1) time complexity.

4. **Hierarchy Representation**: Useful for representing hierarchical data structures.

5. **Editing Software**: Found in software like Microsoft Excel and spreadsheets for organizing and manipulating data.

6. **Database Indexing**: Applied in segmenting and indexing databases and storing cache in computer systems.

7. **Syntax Trees**: Employed by compilers like GCC and AOCL for parsing and executing arithmetic operations.

8. **Priority Queues**: Implemented to maintain a collection of elements with priorities.

9. **Fast Element Retrieval**: Binary Search Trees are used to find elements quickly in sorted lists.

10. **Memory Allocation**: Enables efficient memory allocation in computer systems.

11. **Encoding and Decoding**: Used in encoding and decoding operations, such as cryptographic algorithms.

12. **Data Retrieval**: Organizing and retrieving information from large datasets, e.g., inverted index and k-d trees.

13. **Decision Making**: Representing decision-making processes in computer-controlled characters in games, e.g., decision trees.

14. **Searching Algorithms**: Implementing searching algorithms, such as Binary Search Trees (BSTs) for efficient element retrieval.

15. **Sorting Algorithms**: Heap Sort, which utilizes a binary heap, is used for efficient sorting.

Binary Trees play a crucial role in various computer science domains and are essential for optimizing data storage and retrieval operations.

## Binary Tree Traversals

Tree traversal algorithms are used to explore and visit nodes in a binary tree. These algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithms**
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithms**

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithms

Depth-First Search algorithms involve exploring as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. They can be further categorized into three types:

#### Preorder Traversal (current-left-right)

In Preorder Traversal, you visit the current node before exploring its left or right subtrees. The traversal order is root – left child – right child.

#### Inorder Traversal (left-current-right)

In Inorder Traversal, you visit the current node after exploring all nodes in the left subtree but before visiting any node in the right subtree. The traversal order is left child – root – right child.

#### Postorder Traversal (left-right-current)

In Postorder Traversal, you visit the current node after exploring all nodes in the left and right subtrees. The traversal order is left child – right child – root.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

Breadth-First Search algorithms involve exploring nodes level by level, visiting all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level. This traversal is known as:

#### Level Order Traversal

In Level Order Traversal, you visit nodes level by level in a left-to-right fashion. It starts from the root node, then moves to the leftmost child and continues to the right. This traversal provides a level-wise view of the tree.

### Traversing a Binary Tree

Let's traverse the following binary tree with all four traversal methods:

![Binary Tree](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221125145811/level.png)

- **Pre-order Traversal**: 1-2-4-5-3-6-7
- **In-order Traversal**: 4-2-5-1-6-3-7
- **Post-order Traversal**: 4-5-2-6-7-3-1
- **Level-order Traversal**: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7

These traversal methods are fundamental for exploring and analyzing binary trees, providing different perspectives on the structure of the tree.

## Binary Tree Implementation in Java

Let's create a simple binary tree with 4 nodes, as shown below:

![Binary Tree](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221125150058/root.png)

```java
// Class containing left and right child
// of current node and key value
class Node {
	int key;
	Node left, right;

	public Node(int item) {
		key = item;
		left = right = null;
	}
}

// A Java program to introduce Binary Tree
class BinaryTree {
	// Root of Binary Tree
	Node root;

	// Constructors
	BinaryTree(int key) { root = new Node(key); }
	BinaryTree() { root = null; }

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BinaryTree tree = new BinaryTree();

		// Create root
		tree.root = new Node(1);
		/* Following is the tree after the above statement:
		   1
		  / \
		 null null
		*/

		tree.root.left = new Node(2);
		tree.root.right = new Node(3);
		/* 2 and 3 become the left and right children of 1:
		   1
		  / \
		 2   3
		*/

		tree.root.left.left = new Node(4);
		/* 4 becomes the left child of 2:
		   1
		  / \
		 2   3
		/ \
		4  null
		*/
	}
}
```

- **Space Inefficiency**: Binary trees can be space-inefficient due to the memory overhead of two child pointers per node.

- **Worst-Case Performance**: In the worst-case scenario, a binary tree can become degenerate, leading to search operations degrading to O(n) time complexity.

- **Complex Balancing Algorithms**: To maintain balance, various complex balancing algorithms like AVL trees and red-black trees may be required, adding complexity and overhead.

These characteristics and applications illustrate the versatility and considerations associated with Binary Trees.
